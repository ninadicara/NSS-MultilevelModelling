# NSS-MultilevelModelling
#### Modelling the National Student Survey to Predict Overall Satisfaction [Thesis]

This repository contains the R scripts and LaTeX code for my final year undergraduate thesis. The final report can be read in 'Nina Di Cara Final Year Project.pdf'. 

The aim of the project was to investigate which of the questions from the National Student Survey (NSS), a national survey of satisfaction from final year undergraduates, were most likely to predict high 'Overall Satisfaction'. This is a question of interest to universites who are seeking to understand which aspects of student's education is most likely to lead them to rate the university highly overall.  

The project is approached from a multilevel modelling perspective, using a heirarchy of cohort, within subject code, within university for aggregated NSS data from UK universities from the past ten years.
